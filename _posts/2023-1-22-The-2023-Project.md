As we begin 2023, I have made the decision to challenge myself. To get back into the swing of game programming and development, for each month of 2023, I plan on making one game.
These games will be based off of games you see on mobile ads. Nothing complicated, nothing special.
These will serve as a way for me to better my programming and design skills while I'm having fun!
