title: February's Project
---

While I did *technically* start a project in January, I did not give myself anywhere near enough time to complete it. I am using that project as a testing/mess
around project for the time being.

For Ferbruary however, I am going to be building a very simple farming simulator using assets from itch.io (will be linked once found and used). Keep in mind that 
these projects are not in any way supposed to show my art skills. I am a programmer, not an artist. I enjoy art and I love design but I do not classify myself as an 
artist. Because of that, I gotta rely on others right now! T.T
